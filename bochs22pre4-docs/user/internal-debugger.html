is generally useful for the debugger, let me know and I'll implement
it if possible.</P

      - valid denotes if the segment register holds a validated shadow descriptor
      - inhibit_int is set if the previous instruction was one which delays the
          acceptance of interrupts by one instruction (STI, MOV SS)
      - any errors encountered by the set_cpu command, are reported by
        "Error: ...".  They may be reported after any of the input lines,
        or after the "done" line, during limit checks.
      - A successful set_cpu command ends with the separate line:
        "OK".</PRE

                              Use "set $disassemble_size =" to tell

                              want the first instruction disassembled.
  set $disassemble_size = n   Tell debugger what segment size to use when
                              the "disassemble" command is used.  Use values
                              of 0, 16 or 32 for n.  Value of 0 means
			      "use segment size specified by current CS
			      segment". Default is 0.

  set $auto_disassemble = n   Cause debugger to disassemble current instruction
                              every time execution stops if n=1.  Default is 0.
                              Segment size of current CPU context is used for

>&#13;To use instrumentation features in bochs, you must compile in support for it.
You should build a custom instrumentation library in a separate directory in
the "instrument/" directory.  To tell configure which instrumentation library
you want to use, use the "--enable-instrumentation" option.

The default library consists of a set of stubs, and the following are
equivalent:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>  ./configure [...] --enable-instrumentation
  ./configure [...] --enable-instrumentation="instrument/stubs"</PRE
>

You could make a separate directory with your custom library,
for example "instrument/myinstrument", copy the contents of
the "instrument/stubs" directory to it, then customize it.  Use:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>  ./configure [...] --enable-instrumentation="instrument/myinstrument"</PRE

Disable tracing.

Print the current time (number of ticks since start of simulation
(modulo 2^32)).

<PRE

Playback console input from file <VAR
